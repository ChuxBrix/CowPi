# CowPi
A water level indicator for Raspberry Pi. Designed to be used on a cow trough.
The 3rd and 6th GPIO pins are used to connect a simple float switch.
This is set up for a NO float switch, but simply reversing the button states in the code would enable it for a NC switch 

The Pi this was initially designed for is housed in a remote cow pasture that has access to a 5G wifi hotspot for connectivity.
